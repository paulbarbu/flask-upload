This is an application that lets users upload files through the web provided 
that they already have an account.

I wrote/I'm writing this application in order to learn python web development
with Flask.

Things learned in this project (random order)
==============================
* Flask - a micro web framework
* how to use a template engine (Jinja2)
* the unittest module in stdlib for testing
* mock - mocking objects and monkey patching for isolation tests
* SQLite3 database
* flask-KVSession for managing the sessions on server side
* a little bit of JS for the dynamically adding upload fields

Note: this application is almost the same as bottle-upload, just the framework
differs
